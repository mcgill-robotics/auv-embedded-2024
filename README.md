# McGill Robotics AUV embedded
Hello there, welcome to the AUV embedded software. This Repository is created and maintained by the 2024 McGill Robotic AUV Electrical team. The repository is a tool for us to share, calibrate, and perform version control on the embedded software we develop. You can also find resources like team structure, task management, and tutorials on ROS and Arduino.
